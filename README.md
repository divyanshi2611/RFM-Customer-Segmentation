# üìä RFM Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project performs **customer segmentation** using **Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)** analysis and **K-Means clustering**, based on the [Online Retail dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail?resource=download).

## üîç Overview

1. Extracts behavioral customer metrics (**RFM**)
2. Normalizes data, determines the **optimal number of clusters** (Elbow Method)
3. Applies **K-Means** to segment customers into meaningful groups
4. Creates **visualizations** (scatter plots, boxplots) for insights

## üöÄ How to Use

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divyanshi2611/RFM-Customer-Segmentation.git
cd RFM-Customer-Segmentation
```
---
**2. Install dependencies**

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn notebook
```
---
**3. Download the dataset**

Download OnlineRetail.csv from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.
---
**4. Run the analysis pipeline**

```bash
jupyter notebook rfm_segmentation.ipynb
```
---
**5. Explore**

**Expected Outputs**

RFM features:

**Recency** = Days since last purchase

**Frequency** = Number of purchases

**Monetary** = Total spending

**Elbow plot**: Helps choose number of clusters

**Cluster assignments**: Groups customers (loyal, at-risk, new, etc.)

**Visualizations**: Scatter plots & boxplots for each cluster

## Insights

**1Ô∏è‚É£ RFM Distribution by Cluster (Boxplots)**

Cluster 2 has customers with the highest Monetary value and lowest Recency, meaning they are your most loyal and profitable customers.

Cluster 1 has customers with high Recency but low Frequency and Monetary, indicating inactive or churned customers.

Cluster 0 represents moderate Frequency and low Monetary, possibly occasional buyers.

Cluster 3 contains a small group with high Frequency but relatively low Monetary, suggesting frequent low-value buyers.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Elbow Method (Optimal Number of Clusters)**

The elbow curve shows a sharp decline in WCSS until k=4, after which the reduction flattens.

This indicates that 4 clusters is the optimal choice for customer segmentation, balancing accuracy and simplicity.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation Scatter Plot (RFM Clusters)**

The scatter plot clearly separates customers into 4 clusters based on Recency and Monetary value.

Cluster 2 stands out as high-value customers with high spending.

Cluster 1 contains inactive/churned customers (high Recency, low Monetary).

Cluster 0 are average-value customers with low Recency and moderate spend.

Cluster 3 includes frequent but low-spending customers.
